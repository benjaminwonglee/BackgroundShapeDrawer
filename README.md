# BackgroundShapeDrawer
This is a background shape drawer which draws shapes on a background with chosen colours.

Currently there is one related project to this going on. It is the series of pages of themed colours; this program should output a bitmap of shapes to put on the backgrounds for the HTML pages in that project. 

The first thing to do is to click "Fork" and fork your own copy of this to your GitHub account.

**AIM**

Ultimately, the aims of this project include creating a png output to add backgrounds for the PageOfThemedColours project, improving coding skills to create something interesting, using version control effectively; avoiding merge conflicts by committing code relatively frequently, and working as a team.

**RULES**

Please note any of the issues you're fixing on the "Issues" section before going ahead and fixing them so we have a log of the issues that are being addressed and fixed throughout the project. 

Please respect version control and practice using branches whenever possible. Resolving merge conflicts is a manual thing where you have to go through whole files and decide what should go where; it's a hassle; so try to keep changes to a small set of files and commit relatively frequently; this is called continuous integration; a well-known version control practice.

Good luck!
